     <h1> About Me: </h1>
  <p> Born in the 80’s, with a love of power ballads, and all things My Little Pony, I’m <strong>Keegan Ariel</strong>. I am a newbie programer who is really excited to learn as many things as i can about how to be the best programer I can be! I am really excited about learning <strong>Javascript</strong> and to discover how much I can do with coding. </p>

  <h1> My Home: </h1>
  <p> I was born on at home in <strong>Portland Oregon</strong>. My parents were hippies and raised me with lots of strong ideals and a <a href="http://www.doityourself.com"><strong>DIY</strong></a> mentality. This city is growing up so fast that I often feel like I’m a kind of unicorn around here lately as it is pretty rare to find other people who actually grew up here. </p>

  <h1>Fun Facts:</h1>
  <h2> Dream Job: </h2>
  <p> I’d love to do something with code and music. I make electronic music, and I’d love to do something totally crazy with <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/"><strong>MAX</strong></a> or make something for <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/"><strong>Native Instruments</strong></a>. </p>
  
  <h2> Important Things: </h2>
  <p>Music is a driving force in my life, making it and consuming other people's. I also love making new connections with people and I try to learn something new every day!</p>

  <h2> My favorite things: </h2>
  <p> I have the best little <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/vUCIUSteoR/">puppy</a></strong> in the world and we like to go hiking or on adventures on the weekends. I love to read long nerdy books and going to the record store too. </p>

  <h2> Favorite Music: </h2>
  <p> In the last couple weeks I’ve been listening to the new <strong>Grimes</strong> nonstop. Her new album,<a href="http://www.grimesmusic.com/videos/"> Art Angels</a>, reminds me of electronic video game music from the future. I’ve also been spinning the new cut, <a href="http://tumblr.santigold.com/cantgetenough.html">Can’t Get Enough of Myself</a>, from <strong>Santigold’s</strong> upcoming album, 99¢. </p>
